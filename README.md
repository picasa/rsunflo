# rsunflo
Tools for phenotyping, simulating and modelling with the SUNFLO crop model

A set of tools for working with the SUNFLO crop model at different steps. 
The input step is covered with tools for computing genotypic input parameters from phenotyped variables and dealing with file formats of input variables.
Multi-simulation is simplified with tools for designing virtual experiments and simulating.
Tools for tracking the variation of prediction capacity along with model development are also included.

To install the development version of rsunflo please use the `devtools` package:

    # install.packages("devtools")
    library(devtools)
    install_github("ggplot2")
